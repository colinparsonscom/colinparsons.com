      <h2>Now</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a growth software engineer at
        <a href="https://www.clay.com" target="_blank">Clay</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Before</h2>

      <p>
        In high school, I began studying math at
        <a href="https://ulo.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford ULO</a>
        when I was 16. I led the team at
        <a href="http://www.gravitygames.org/starcatcher.html" target="_blank"
          >GravityGames</a
        >, making the first-ever game to be 3D printed on the International
        Space Station. I used data analysis and AI to improve our eye-tracking
        algorithm at
        <a
          href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eyefluence"
          target="_blank"
          >Eyefluence</a
        >, where we built an eye-based UI for VR and AR viewers. We were
        acquired by Google.<br /><br />

        In college, I studied math and Spanish at
        <a href="https://wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WashU</a>. I researched AI
        cybersecurity threat detection at
        <a href="https://www.delinea.com/" target="_blank">Delinea</a>, where we
        created identity-as-a-service enterprise solutions. We were acquired by
        Thoma Bravo. I wrote scripts to improve portfolio visibility for the
        asset diversification team at
        <a href="https://endowment.wustl.edu/" target="_blank"
          >WashU's endowment</a
        >. I researched $100m-$500m enterprise value software businesses for
        potential acquisition at a PE fund called
        <a href="https://redirongroup.com/" target="_blank">Red Iron Group</a>.
        At <a href="https://contrary.com/" target="_blank">Contrary</a>, a
        university-focused venture fund, I was a venture partner, then led the
        summer accelerator for portfolio companies, then was an EIR.<br /><br />

        I built lots of projects in college, including
        <a href="https://www.warmglue.com" target="_blank">a bot</a> that found
        sales intros based on email traffic,
        <a href="https://www.swellcut.com" target="_blank">a website</a> that
        created custom clothing designs using AI, and a quarantine
        <a
          href="https://quarantoned-4b1193c22aacfa3903707cb9b7b.webflow.io/"
          target="_blank"
          >virtual fitness community</a
        >. When I graduated, I become a solo founder. I pivoted from providing
        <a href="https://www.snugstack.com/" target="_blank"
          >infrastructure and marketing testing</a
        >
        for small and medium businesses to doing
        <a
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therubberduckiee/video/7086917877458160939"
          target="_blank"
          >fully automated content marketing</a
        >, using AI to automatically create ads, articles, and videos for
        companies. After being paid $10k from clients and raising $100k for an
        angel round, I decided I didn't have the necessary long-term conviction,
        and turned down the money. Instead, I joined a
        <a
          href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/unlisted-homes"
          target="_blank"
          >stealth startup</a
        >
        as the founding engineer, built our backend and our frontend, and led
        our engineering team. We were creating a marketplace for off-market real
        estate, but the startup failed.

      <h2>Personal</h2>

      <p>
        I'm from Oakland. I grew up in a small town called Moraga, and I've
        lived in St. Louis and Madrid. Now, I live in Cambridge (Massachusetts),
        and I work in New York. I love hiking, playing and watching soccer
        (YNWA), dancing the tango, eating Zachary's pizza during Warriors games,
        building things with my hands (once upon a time I won first prize in the
        California State Fair for my chessboard), playing with
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/masala_theaussie/" target="_blank"
          >my dog</a
        >, and offering moral support to
        <a href="https://annikamammen.com/" target="_blank">my girlfriend</a>
        during 49ers games and Formula 1 races.
