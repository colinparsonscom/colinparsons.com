<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>I’m a rising junior at <a href="https://wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WashU</a> majoring in math, philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, and minoring in Spanish. I've always been passionate about math, so I started taking math courses <a href="http://ulo.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">online from Stanford</a> around my sophomore year of high school. As a result of this focus, I got connected in high school with a program called <a href="http://www.gravitygames.org/" target="_blank">GravityGames</a>, where I led the team making the first-ever game to be 3D printed on the International Space Station via <a href="http://madeinspace.us/" target="_blank">MadeInSpace</a>'s 3D printer! That game was called <a href="http://www.gravitygames.org/starcatcher.html" target="_blank">StarCatcher</a>, and I'm now, in partnership with <a href="http://seds.org/" target="_blank">SEDS</a>, I'm expanding GravityGames into a nationwide program so that college students across the country can make games on the ISS. Through GravityGames, I got connected with a VR company in the Bay Area and started manufacturing my own virtual reality viewers. After showing my work to the team, I joined the data analysis group at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eyefluence" target="_blank">Eyefluence</a> just before the end of my time in high school. I then came to college, and we were acquired by Google about two months into my time at WashU! At Eyefluence, I was really impressed by a machine learning technique called neural networks. I taught myself a bit about these, then worked in computer vision and machine learning research at an enterprise security company called <a href="https://www.centrify.com/" target="_blank">Centrify</a>. I've worked for a little while in asset diversification at <a href="https://endowment.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WashU's endowment</a>. I was also approached by Eyefluence’s former CEO about joining his AI startup <a href="http://rivaltheory.com/" target="_blank">Rival Theory</a>! I worked both on the technical side, considering models for basic concept learning and consciousness, as well as on the business side, in strategy. Now, I lead a 4-person team at WashU for a venture capital firm called <a href="http://contrarycap.com/" target="_blank">Contrary</a>, investing pre-seed capital in companies started by students, professors, and recent graduates. I’m managing our first-ever “Summer in SF” accelerator. Besides helping out our portfolio companies this summer, I’m building a machine learning system with a friend that we hope will offer some significant progress in hierarchical concept learning and generalization! This project will likely become my main focus during my remaining two years at WashU.</p>
