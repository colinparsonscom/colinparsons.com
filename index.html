        <h2>Now</h2>

        <p>I'm a growth engineer at Clay.</p>

        <h2>Before</h2>

        <p>
          In high school, I studied a lot of math, beginning with some
          grad-level
          <a href="https://ulo.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford ULO</a>
          math courses in my sophomore year. I led the team at
          <a href="http://www.gravitygames.org/starcatcher.html" target="_blank"
            >GravityGames</a
          >, making the first-ever game to be 3D-printed on the International
          Space Station. I worked on eye-tracking algorithms at
          <a
            href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eyefluence"
            target="_blank"
            >Eyefluence</a
          >, making an eye-based UI for VR and AR viewers. We were acquired by
          Google in October 2016.<br /><br />

          In college, I was a Venture Partner at
          <a href="https://contrary.com/" target="_blank">Contrary</a>, a
          university-focused venture fund. I worked on asset diversification at
          <a href="https://endowment.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WUIMC</a>,
          managing the university endowment. I did machine learning research at
          <a href="https://www.delinea.com/" target="_blank">Delinea</a>,
          creating identity-as-a-service enterprise solutions. We were acquired
          by Thoma Bravo in August 2018. I researched concept development in
          machine learning systems at
          <a
            href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rival-theory"
            target="_blank"
            >Rival Theory</a
          >, designing AI personas of real people. I led
          <a href="https://contrary.com/" target="_blank">Contrary’s</a>
          accelerator for portfolio companies. I did investment pipeline
          research for an unannounced fund. I was an EIR at
          <a href="https://contrary.com/" target="_blank">Contrary’s</a>
          accelerator. I got a degree in math and Spanish from
          <a href="https://wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WashU</a>.<br /><br />

          I built lots of projects in college, including
          <a href="https://www.warmglue.com" target="_blank">a bot</a> that
          found sales intros based on email traffic,
          <a href="https://www.swellcut.com" target="_blank">a website</a> that
          created custom clothing designs using AI, and a quarantine
          <a
            href="https://quarantoned-4b1193c22aacfa3903707cb9b7b.webflow.io/"
            target="_blank"
            >virtual fitness community</a
          >. When I graduated, I become a solo founder. I pivoted from providing
          <a href="https://www.snugstack.com/" target="_blank"
            >infrastructure and marketing testing</a
          >
          for small and medium businesses to doing
          <a
            href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therubberduckiee/video/7086917877458160939"
            target="_blank"
            >fully automated content marketing</a
          >, using AI to automatically create ads, articles, and videos for
          clients. After being paid $10k from clients and raising $100k for an
          angel round, I took a step back and decided I didn't want to take the
          money. Instead, I joined a stealth startup as the founding engineer,
          built a backend and a frontend, and managed other engineers. The
          startup failed.

        <h2>Personal</h2>

        <p>
          I love hiking, playing and watching soccer (YNWA), dancing the tango,
          eating Zachary's pizza during Warriors games, building things with my
          hands (once upon a time I won first prize in the California State Fair
          for my chessboard), playing with
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/masala_theaussie/" target="_blank"
            >my dog</a
          >, and offering moral support to
          <a href="https://annikamammen.com/" target="_blank">my girlfriend</a>
          during 49ers games and Formula 1 races.
